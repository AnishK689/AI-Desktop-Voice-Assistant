- **Data Storage:** Jarvis can save its responses to text files for future reference, ensuring that no valuable insights are lost.

## Setup and Usage

1. Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Create a `config.py` file with your OpenAI API key (apikey) and other configurations.

3. Run the `main.py` script to start Jarvis. Ask questions, give commands, and enjoy the interactions.

4. Jarvis listens for voice input, performs the requested actions, and responds using its vocal capabilities.

## Configuration

- Tailor the `sites` and `apps` lists in the code to customize Jarvis' ability to open specific websites and applications.

- Adapt paths to music files, application executables, and other resources based on your system configuration.

- You can personalize Jarvis' voice by adjusting the `speaker.Voice` settings to match your preferred vocal style.
